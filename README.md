# k8s-tutorial
## A Introductory Kubernettes Tutorial Using Docker and Minikube
### Objectives:
* Understand Docker basics well enough to get started with K8S. 
* Deploy a Docker container to miniKube to learn more about K8S.
* Know where to go to for additional reference/learning.

### Prerequisites:

1. [vBox](/setup/vbox/README.md) if your OS is Windows, otherwise skip to the next step.
1. Miscelaneous [tools](/setup/tools/README.md) you'll need (if you don't already have them).
1. [Docker Engine](/setup/docker/README.md) setup for Mac OS or vBox.
1. Finally, [minikube](/setup/minikube/README.md).

### Labs:
* [Docker Basics](/labs/docker/README.md)
* [K8S basics using minikube](/labs/k8s/README.md)
